Here's why:

Maintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is [hard work](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/). As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.

As a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:

1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);
2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.

For (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.

For (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.`
